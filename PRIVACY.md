# Privacy Policy

## Data Collection and Storage

VettaVista is designed with privacy as a fundamental principle. We do not collect, store, or transmit any of your personal data, job search information, or application materials to our servers or any third-party services (with the exception noted below).

All data processing occurs locally on your device. This includes:
- Job listing information from LinkedIn
- Filtering results and preferences
- Generated resume and cover letter content
- Application tracking information
- Configuration settings

## Data Transmission

The only data transmitted outside of your local machine are the prompts sent to Anthropic's API service when utilizing Claude for AI-assisted features. These prompts may contain:
- Job listing information necessary for analysis
- Portions of your resume or cover letter needed for customization
- Job requirements for matching purposes

These transmissions:
- Use your own personal API key
- Are subject to Anthropic's [privacy policy](https://privacy.anthropic.com/en/collections/10672411-data-handling-retention) and [terms of service](https://privacy.anthropic.com/en/collections/10672414-policies-terms-of-service)
- Are necessary for the core AI functionality of VettaVista

## Third-Party Services

VettaVista interacts with the following third-party services:
1. LinkedIn - to access job listing information
2. Anthropic - to process AI requests via Claude

VettaVista does not share your data with any other third parties, advertisers, or data brokers.

## Data Retention

Since all data is stored locally on your device, you maintain complete control over data retention. You may delete any stored data at any time by removing the local files or uninstalling the application.

## Changes to Privacy Policy

Any substantial changes to this privacy policy will be communicated through updated documentation in new releases.

By using VettaVista, you acknowledge and agree to the terms outlined in this privacy policy.
